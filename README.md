# City Fruit Volunteer Project - Visualizing Seattler's Fruit Trees

**Project Summary:** Through this project, a volunteer would analyze publicly available tree data from the City of Seattle (151,000+ trees with location data) and create a compelling, interactive visualization of fruit trees from that data set using Tableau Public. City Fruit would then review and evaluatesharing the visualization on its website so that community members can better understand and engage withSeattle’s urban fruit trees.

**Why Now:** With April 2020 including the 50thanniversary of Earth Day (April 22nd) followed closely by Arbor Day (April 24th), we thought this would be a great time for a volunteer to create such a visualization for our communityand celebrate Seattle’s urban orchard.

## ABOUT CITY FRUIT

**City Fruit’s Mission: City Fruit puts our urban orchard to its best and fullest use so that everyone inour community shares in the value of fruit.**

Urban fruit trees are a valuable community resource, yet often fruit goes unused because people are not sure when to harvest it, how to best use it, or they are put off by damage caused by preventable disease and pests. We are reclaiming the urban orchard, showing people how to harvest what they need, and to share the rest with others. We help tree owners grow healthy fruit, provide assistance in harvesting and preserving fruit, promote the sharing of extra fruit, and work to protect urban fruit trees.

## PROJECT IMPACT

1. Community Engagementand Education
  * Community members often aska lot of questions when learning of City Fruit and its mission. Questions like:
    * “Are there fruit trees in ABCPark?”
    * “What kinds of fruit trees are in Seattle?”
    
    Providing a visual, interactive view of trees in Seattle will help engage our community further and expose them to the opportunity City Fruit sees to make an impact in Seattle.
2. Urban Canopy Assessment
  * Some work has been done elsewhere on Seattle’s general Urban Tree Canopy (example: Trees for Seattle Street Trees), however we would like to go further and better understand where there are opportunities to (A) grow the urban canopy and (B) specifically grow more fruit trees.This directly aligns with some of City Fruit’s long-term goals in our 5 Year Plan.
  
## PROJECT DATA  

For this specific project, we would like volunteers to use publicly available tree data from the City of Seattle. This data set includes 151,000 trees, most of which are not fruit trees. This is not an exhaustive data set of trees in Seattle.  Note that City Fruit does retain our own database of fruit trees that we manage. However, due to privacy considerations for private tree owners, we have decided at this time to limit this communityfacing project to publicly available data. The outcome of this volunteer project may result in follow-on projects where we would have volunteers assist the organization with creating internal-facing visualizations of our own fruit tree data to further support the organization.
